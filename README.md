# PhotoShare

PhotoShare is an android application developed by Hala and Ola as a final project in NSSL lab in the Technion.
The app offers a convenient and easy-to-use platform for events photo sharing between event's organizers and attendees.
Users can create events of two types: public event or private event - an event that is protected by a password. Guests can join an existing event in two different ways: manually be added by one of the admins, or when they're at the event, the app automatically detects the events taking place near them and suggests they join those events. Each event has a dedicated page that contains a list of the guests and the crowd sourced album of the event where every guest can add photos that were taken at the event.
