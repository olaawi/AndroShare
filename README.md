# AndroShare

PhotoShare is an android application developed by Hala and Ola for NSSL lab in Technion.
The app offers a convenient and easy-to-use platform for events photo sharing between event's organizers and attendees.
Users can create events of two types: public or private that is protected by password. Guests can join an existing event in two different 
ways: manually be added by oneof the admins or when they're at the event, the app automatically detects the events taking place near them 
and suggests they join those events. Each event has a dedicated page that contains a list of the guests and the crowd sourced album of the 
event where every guest can add photos that were taken at the event.
